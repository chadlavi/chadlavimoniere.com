chadlavmoniere.com is built by a small team of zero engineers, one designer,
zero researchers, a few robots, and no others in any different sites across the
globe. It is updated sometimes, and built with a number of tools and
technologies than one could feasibly shake a stick at. If you'd like to hire
Chad, head to chadlavimoniere.com/contact, and tell 'em the humans.txt file sent
ya.
